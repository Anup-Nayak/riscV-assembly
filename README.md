Wrote RISC-V assembly code for the following:
1. Print name and Entry number.
   
2. Store 10 values in an array by getting input from the user. Sum the values. Print the sum.

3. Read a 10 character alphanumeric string X. Print a string that contains one letter
from your name followed by 1 letter/number from X.

*IMPORTANT*
4. Write a program to add large numbers. Assume that your numbers don’t fit in 64
bits. Specifically for this problem, write a program that can add numbers upto 26
[4 x 64] bits.

5. Write a program that takes an integer as input and outputs Fib(n) where Fib(n) is
the nth Fibonacci Number.

6. For a given input tuple [𝑛, 𝑟] {𝑛, 𝑟 ≤ 20}, print the value of ( n𝐶r ) where you have defined a
function for factorial fact(n) = n!.

7. Tail- recursive sum problem [A]. Straightforward assembly program of this recursive routine [B]. 
Also wrote the iterative version of the program [C]. A plot which
shows how the performance [cycles or time] varies with diXerent values of n for A, B and C.

*IMPORTANT*
8. A function in RISC-V assembly to convert an ASCII string containing a positive or negative integer decimal string to an
integer. The RISC-V mul instruction takes two registers as input. There is no “muli”
instruction. Now call this function to implemented a function [program] that can perform
[add|mul|sub|div] of two numbers where the input are two strings and the operator
[[add|mul|sub|div]]. [implementation of atoi() function which is available in many
Programming Languages].
