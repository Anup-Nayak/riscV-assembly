Wrote RISC-V assembly code for the following:
1. Print name and Entry number.
   
2. Store 10 values in an array by getting input from the user. Sum the values. Print the sum.

3. Read a 10 character alphanumeric string X. Print a string that contains one letter
from your name followed by 1 letter/number from X.

*IMPORTANT*

4. Write a program to add large numbers. Assume that your numbers donâ€™t fit in 64
bits. Specifically for this problem, write a program that can add numbers upto 26
[4 x 64] bits.

5. Write a program that takes an integer as input and outputs Fib(n) where Fib(n) is
the nth Fibonacci Number.
